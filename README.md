# Traffic-Light-Detection-Duckietown
Traffic Light Detection for Duckiebot (Duckietown Project). 
This is a duckietown project that functions as a traffic light detector. 
The results that I uploaded use a 8mm led traffic light every color controlled by Arduino. 
And the program is still a lot of bugs and far from perfect. 
Please, if anyone who can improve can give me advice through comments. 
May be useful, Thanks.
